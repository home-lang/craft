/**
 * Locate the `craft` native binary.
 *
 * The shipping contract is: **Craft is distributed via the pantry
 * registry**. `pantry install craft` (or any pantry-managed environment
 * that includes craft) puts the binary on PATH; the SDK and CLI then
 * just spawn `'craft'` directly. The previous "look in zig-out, then
 * fall back to PATH" probing is gone — it was load-bearing in the
 * monorepo dev loop, but consumers of the SDK / CLI should never see it.
 *
 * Two escape hatches remain, in order of precedence:
 *
 *   1. `config.craftPath` (SDK only): an explicit absolute path the
 *      caller pinned. Validated to exist; otherwise we throw.
 *   2. `CRAFT_BIN` env var: same idea, useful for tests and for the
 *      monorepo dev loop where the binary lives at
 *      `packages/zig/zig-out/bin/craft` and isn't yet a registry build.
 *
 * Everything else delegates to `'craft'` and lets the OS resolve PATH.
 * If the spawn produces ENOENT we surface a single, deterministic error
 * pointing at pantry — no path probing, no matrix of "we tried these
 * locations" output, just one canonical answer.
